Title: Intertextuality
created: 2025-02-08

I *love* intertextuality. Works of art that reference or critique other works of art. Here are some of my favorite examples:

#### Music
- American Pie, Don McLean
- Blinded by the Light, Bruce Springsteen (though the Manfred Mann version is arguably *more* intertextual)
- Pretty much everything on Fugee's The Score
- Spirit of the Radio, Rush
- Wrapped Around Your Finger, The Police
#### Books
- [[Oathbreakers]] by Matthew Gabriele and David Perry

...this list will grow with time as I think of more things.
