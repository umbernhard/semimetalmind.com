They should be shorter.

At the risk of undermining my own point, I will expand a very little bit. I think so many philosophical works can be boiled down to a handful of points, and so often the words of the writer only serve to further obscure the point they're trying to get across. I think Paul Feyerabend understood this to some extent, which is why the Analytical Index at the start of Against Method was included.

To quote...someone, "If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."
