This is a blog. It's maintained via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Jekyll](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow).

The name is a play on Brandon Sanderson's metalminds from the Mistborn series, and the fact that I'm using computers to store knowledge/remember things (silicon is a semimetal). Now that I've explained the joke, isn't it so much funnier?
